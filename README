Notes on using git

Cheat sheet
-----------

After modifying a file, you must add it to the repo. I know, it is already there, but just
do this:

	git add .

The final dot means add all the modified files.

To see what has been added to the repo:

	git status

These are all the files ready to be commited.

	git commit

will bring up an editor and you enter your message. Then exit the editor and the commit
happens. This is just a local commit. Commit your brains out.

	git push

pushes the local repository to the remote.


Git Setup
---------
The github.com site has a very good help file under Help > Beginner > Set up git.
Downloading git is explained and the setup of ssh is also detailed. I followed the
instructions there and found true happiness.


To create a local repository; in the root of the tree you want as the repository

	git init

This creates a .git directory in your current working directory. All the git info will be here.

Now declare the remote repository:

	git remote add origin git@github.com:LTI/iOSMobileApp.git


After doing
	git close git://github.com/LTI/iOSMobileApp.git
I had to do
	git remote set-url origin git@github.com:LTI/iOSMobileApp.git
to make
	git push
work simply. On my laptop I have to enter my passphrase, but that seems to be an ssh issue.



git push


You will have to have setup the SSH keys. This is done in the account settings from the
github web page for your account. There is a guide you can follow.

The above instructions are only for the initial populating of the repository. I have already
done this.



To get a new copy of the repo:

	git clone git://github.com/LTI/iOSMobileApp
