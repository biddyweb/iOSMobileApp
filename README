Notes on using git

To create a local repository; in the root of the tree you want as the repository

git init

This creates a .git directory in your current working directory. All the git info will be here.

Now declare the remote repository:

git remote add origin git@github.com:LTI/iOSMobileApp.git

And now push the new repository:

git push -u origin master

You will have to have setup the SSH keys. This is done in the account settings from the
github web page for your account. There is a guide you can follow.

The above instructions are only for the initial populating of the repository. I have already
done this.

To get a new copy of the repo:

git clone git://github.com/LTI/iOSMobileApp
